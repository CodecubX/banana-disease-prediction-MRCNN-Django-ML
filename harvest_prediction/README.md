# Banana Harvest Prediction Model

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning classifier to predict the harvest of a banana plant.

## Features
The model takes in several inputs related to the banana plant, such as the plant's variety, agro-climatic region, plant density, spacing between plants, and more. These inputs are used to predict the yield of the banana plant.
